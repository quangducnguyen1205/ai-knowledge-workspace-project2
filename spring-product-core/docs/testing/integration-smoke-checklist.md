# Integration Smoke Checklist

This checklist reflects the current `workspace-core` implementation in Repo B. It focuses on the product-facing Spring Boot endpoints that are implemented and testable now.

The helper script at `infra/scripts/smoke-thin-slice.sh` covers the current default-workspace happy path and can exercise a non-default workspace path when `SMOKE_WORKSPACE_NAME` is set.

For the current deployable-demo baseline, the supported verification order is:

1. Start Repo A.
2. Start Repo B infrastructure.
3. Start Repo B Spring Boot on the host.
4. Run backend smoke against `http://localhost:8081`.
5. Start Repo FE and verify the browser path through `http://localhost:5173`.

For this Phase 2 basic-auth slice, the primary product-facing current-user path is now session-based auth through register/login.
`POST /api/auth/session` and `X-Current-User-Id` remain available as secondary local/dev fallbacks.
If authenticated session, auth-session fallback, and header are all absent, Spring can fall back to the configured local/dev default user when `CURRENT_USER_DEV_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true`.
The smoke helper now follows the authenticated product path by default and only uses the older auth-session shortcut when `SMOKE_USE_LEGACY_AUTH_FALLBACK=1` is set explicitly.

## Helper Shortcut

Default-workspace path:

```bash
./infra/scripts/smoke-thin-slice.sh /absolute/path/to/lecture-video.mp4
```

Non-default workspace path:

```bash
SMOKE_WORKSPACE_NAME="Algorithms" ./infra/scripts/smoke-thin-slice.sh /absolute/path/to/lecture-video.mp4
```

Optional search-to-context follow-up:

```bash
SMOKE_VERIFY_CONTEXT=1 ./infra/scripts/smoke-thin-slice.sh /absolute/path/to/lecture-video.mp4
```

Local shortcut targets:

```bash
make test-workspace-core
make smoke MEDIA_FILE=/absolute/path/to/lecture-video.mp4
make smoke-workspace MEDIA_FILE=/absolute/path/to/lecture-video.mp4 WORKSPACE_NAME="Algorithms"
```

Authenticated smoke overrides:

```bash
make smoke \
  MEDIA_FILE=/absolute/path/to/lecture-video.mp4 \
  SMOKE_AUTH_EMAIL="smoke-user@example.com" \
  SMOKE_AUTH_PASSWORD="password123"
```

For the default localhost path, the helper can still fall back to convenience smoke credentials if those values are omitted. For any non-local `WORKSPACE_CORE_BASE_URL`, set `SMOKE_AUTH_EMAIL` and `SMOKE_AUTH_PASSWORD` explicitly.

Explicit legacy fallback override:

```bash
make smoke \
  MEDIA_FILE=/absolute/path/to/lecture-video.mp4 \
  SMOKE_USE_LEGACY_AUTH_FALLBACK=1 \
  SMOKE_LEGACY_USER_ID="smoke-dev-user"
```

With `SMOKE_WORKSPACE_NAME`, the helper creates a workspace, reads it back, uploads into it, checks workspace-scoped asset listing, indexes the transcript, and searches within that workspace.
With `SMOKE_VERIFY_CONTEXT`, the helper also uses the top search hit to call `GET /api/assets/{assetId}/transcript/context` and prints the returned row window.
The `Makefile` smoke targets require `MEDIA_FILE` explicitly so the repo does not assume a contributor-specific local file path.
The helper now establishes an authenticated backend session with register/login before running the golden path.
If register returns `EMAIL_ALREADY_REGISTERED`, the helper falls back to login with the same credentials so reruns stay repeatable.
Use the legacy fallback path only when you intentionally want a local/dev shortcut rather than the main authenticated product flow.

## 0. Verification Order

- [ ] Run backend smoke against `http://localhost:8081` first.
- [ ] Only treat FE proxy checks as the next layer after backend smoke passes.
- [ ] If backend smoke fails before upload, classify it first as environment, auth-session setup, or Spring runtime issue.
- [ ] If upload or non-terminal status refresh fails with `FASTAPI_CONNECTIVITY_ERROR`, classify it first as an upstream FastAPI readiness/integration issue.
- [ ] If backend smoke passes but browser verification through `http://localhost:5173` fails, classify that first as FE proxy/runtime integration, not immediately as a backend product bug.

## 1. Environment Readiness

### Implemented And Testable Now

- [ ] Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for Repo B.
- [ ] Start Repo B infrastructure with `docker compose --env-file .env -f infra/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`.
- [ ] Confirm Repo B PostgreSQL is up.
- [ ] Confirm Repo B PostgreSQL is using the intended host port `5434`.
- [ ] Confirm Repo B Elasticsearch is up on `9201`.
- [ ] Start Spring Boot for `services/workspace-core`.
- [ ] Check Spring Boot health:
  - [ ] `curl http://localhost:8081/health`
  - [ ] Expect HTTP `200`
  - [ ] Expect JSON with:
    - [ ] `status = "UP"`
    - [ ] `service = "workspace-core"`
- [ ] If you plan to verify the browser path too, start the frontend and confirm `http://localhost:5173` is serving the app shell before treating FE failures as product bugs.

## 2. Upstream FastAPI Readiness

### Implemented And Testable Now

- [ ] Start Repo A separately.
- [ ] Confirm `FASTAPI_BASE_URL` points to the running Repo A instance.
- [ ] Check basic FastAPI reachability:
  - [ ] `curl http://localhost:8000/openapi.json`
  - [ ] Expect HTTP `200` if OpenAPI is enabled locally
- [ ] If OpenAPI is disabled, verify any known Repo A endpoint is reachable before testing Repo B.

### Failure Path

- [ ] Stop Repo A or point `FASTAPI_BASE_URL` to a bad host.
- [ ] Call one product endpoint that needs Repo A, such as upload or status refresh on a non-terminal asset.
- [ ] Expect Repo B to return HTTP `504`.

## 4. Product Upload Flow Checks

### Implemented And Testable Now

- [ ] Call `POST /api/assets/upload` with multipart form data:
  - [ ] `file`

- [ ] Expect HTTP `404`.
- [ ] Expect structured error JSON with:
  - [ ] `code = "WORKSPACE_NOT_FOUND"`

### Upstream Validation Path

- [ ] If you can safely simulate invalid upstream upload behavior in a non-production FastAPI environment, verify that Repo B returns HTTP `502` when the upload response is missing required fields such as `task_id` or `video_id`.
- [ ] If that simulation is not practical, mark this check as pending instead of assuming it passed.

## 5. Product Asset Listing Checks

### Implemented And Testable Now

- [ ] Call `GET /api/assets` without `workspaceId`.
- [ ] Expect HTTP `200`.
- [ ] Confirm the response is a paginated envelope with:
  - [ ] `items`
  - [ ] `page`
  - [ ] `size`
  - [ ] `totalElements`
  - [ ] `totalPages`
  - [ ] `hasNext`
- [ ] Confirm each row inside `items` only contains:
  - [ ] `assetId`
  - [ ] `title`
  - [ ] `assetStatus`
  - [ ] `workspaceId`
  - [ ] `createdAt`
- [ ] Confirm omitted `workspaceId` uses the current user's default workspace scope.

- [ ] Confirm the uploaded asset appears in that workspace-scoped list.
- [ ] Confirm non-default workspace listing only returns assets in that workspace.
- [ ] Re-authenticate as a different user, then call `GET /api/assets`.
- [ ] Confirm assets in another user's workspace do not appear.

### Legacy Default-Workspace Path

- [ ] If you have older local assets with null `workspace_id`, call `GET /api/assets` without `workspaceId`.
- [ ] Confirm those legacy assets still appear only for the configured local/dev default user.
- [ ] Confirm those rows are backfilled to the current user's default workspace after the read path.

### Failure Path

- [ ] If you have a DB fixture or manual record that can represent an asset without a linked processing job, call the status endpoint for that asset.
- [ ] Expect HTTP `409`.

### Upstream Invalid Payload Path

- [ ] If you can safely simulate an upstream task-status response without `status`, verify that Repo B returns HTTP `502`.
- [ ] If you cannot simulate that safely, mark this check as pending.

## 6A. Product Asset Deletion Checks

  - [ ] `id`
  - [ ] `videoId`
  - [ ] `segmentIndex`
  - [ ] `text`
  - [ ] `createdAt`
- [ ] Confirm there are no invented fields such as:
  - [ ] timestamps
  - [ ] speaker labels

  - [ ] message explaining that the transcript is empty or unusable for this asset
- [ ] Confirm the asset is not treated as transcript-ready.
- [ ] Confirm the asset is not treated as searchable.
- [ ] Confirm a later status read does not show the asset as usable.

### Notes

- [ ] Treat this as a required smoke path, not an edge path to skip.
- [ ] Do not record this case as a pass just because upstream processing succeeded.

## 9. Structured Integration Error Handling Checks

### Implemented And Testable Now

- [ ] Treat indexing as operating from the local transcript snapshot in the normal path.
- [ ] Call `POST /api/assets/{assetId}/index`.
- [ ] Expect HTTP `200`.
- [ ] Expect JSON with:
  - [ ] `assetId`
  - [ ] `assetStatus = "SEARCHABLE"`

- [ ] Call `POST /api/assets/{assetId}/index` again for the same asset.
- [ ] Expect HTTP `200` again.
- [ ] Confirm the asset stays `SEARCHABLE` and the rerun does not require cleanup before retrying.

### Failure Path

- [ ] Stop Elasticsearch or point Repo B at an unavailable Elasticsearch host.
- [ ] Call `POST /api/assets/{assetId}/index` for an asset with usable transcript rows.
- [ ] Expect HTTP `503` or `502` depending on the failure mode.
- [ ] If a structured integration error body is returned, confirm:
  - [ ] `code = "ELASTICSEARCH_UNAVAILABLE"` or `ELASTICSEARCH_INTEGRATION_ERROR`
  - [ ] non-empty `message`
- [ ] Call `GET /api/assets/{assetId}/status` after the failed indexing attempt.
- [ ] Confirm the asset is not incorrectly marked `SEARCHABLE`.
- [ ] If you can safely simulate a partial Elasticsearch bulk item failure, confirm the whole indexing request still fails and the asset remains non-`SEARCHABLE`.
- [ ] Call `POST /api/assets/{assetId}/index` for an asset created under one user, but first re-establish the auth session as a different user.
- [ ] Expect the same ownership-safe HTTP `404`.

## 11. Product Search Checks

### Implemented And Testable Now

- [ ] Confirm `workspaceIdFilter` matches the requested workspace or the current user's default workspace when omitted.
- [ ] Confirm search only returns results inside the resolved workspace scope.
- [ ] Confirm search returns only assets that were successfully indexed and are `SEARCHABLE`.
- [ ] If you know a short phrase that appears verbatim in one transcript row or asset title, search for that phrase and confirm the obvious phrase match rises near the top of the returned results.
- [ ] Re-establish the auth session as a different user, then call `GET /api/search?q=your-query`.
- [ ] Confirm results from another user's workspace do not appear.

### Optional Asset Filter Check

- [ ] Call `GET /api/search?q=your-query&assetId=<known-asset-id>`.
- [ ] Confirm `assetIdFilter` matches the requested asset ID.
- [ ] Confirm results are restricted to that asset.
- [ ] Confirm the asset belongs to the same resolved workspace scope used for the search call.

### Optional Workspace Filter Check

- [ ] If you have a known non-default workspace ID in local data, call `GET /api/search?q=your-query&workspaceId=<known-workspace-id>`.
- [ ] Confirm `workspaceIdFilter` matches that workspace ID.
- [ ] Confirm results stay restricted to that workspace.
- [ ] If you use `SMOKE_WORKSPACE_NAME`, confirm the helper's printed `searchWorkspaceId` matches the created workspace ID.

### Search-To-Context Follow-Up

- [ ] After a successful search, pick one result's `transcriptRowId`.
- [ ] If the chosen result has no `transcriptRowId`, use `segment-{segmentIndex}` only for that row.
- [ ] Call `GET /api/assets/{assetId}/transcript/context?transcriptRowId=<rowId>`.
- [ ] Expect HTTP `200`.
- [ ] Confirm the response contains:
  - [ ] `assetId`
  - [ ] `transcriptRowId`
  - [ ] `hitSegmentIndex`
  - [ ] `window`
  - [ ] `rows`
- [ ] Confirm each context row only contains:
  - [ ] `id`
  - [ ] `videoId`
  - [ ] `segmentIndex`
  - [ ] `text`
  - [ ] `createdAt`
- [ ] Call the same endpoint with `window=0`.
- [ ] Expect HTTP `400`.
- [ ] Call the same endpoint with a valid-but-missing `transcriptRowId`.
- [ ] Expect HTTP `404`.
- [ ] Call `GET /api/assets/{assetId}/transcript/context?transcriptRowId=<rowId>` for an asset created under one user, but first re-establish the auth session as a different user.
- [ ] Expect the same ownership-safe HTTP `404`.

### Validation Path

- [ ] Call `GET /api/search?q=` with a blank or whitespace-only query value.
- [ ] Expect HTTP `400`.
- [ ] Expect structured error JSON with:
  - [ ] `code = "INVALID_SEARCH_QUERY"`
- [ ] Call `GET /api/search?q=test&workspaceId=not-a-uuid`.
- [ ] Expect HTTP `400`.
- [ ] Expect structured error JSON with:
  - [ ] `code = "INVALID_WORKSPACE_ID"`
- [ ] Call `GET /api/search?q=test&workspaceId=<valid-but-unknown-uuid>`.
- [ ] Expect HTTP `404`.
- [ ] Expect structured error JSON with:
  - [ ] `code = "WORKSPACE_NOT_FOUND"`
- [ ] Call `GET /api/search?q=test&workspaceId=<workspace-owned-by-another-user>`.
- [ ] Expect the same ownership-safe HTTP `404`.
- [ ] Call `GET /api/search?q=test&workspaceId=<owned-workspace-id>&assetId=<asset-from-a-different-workspace-or-another-user>`.
- [ ] Expect HTTP `404`.
- [ ] Expect structured error JSON with:
  - [ ] `code = "ASSET_NOT_FOUND"`

### Elasticsearch Failure Path

- [ ] Stop Elasticsearch or point Repo B at an unavailable Elasticsearch host.
- [ ] Call `GET /api/search?q=test`.
- [ ] Expect HTTP `503` or `502` depending on the failure mode.
- [ ] If a structured integration error body is returned, confirm:
  - [ ] `code = "ELASTICSEARCH_UNAVAILABLE"` or `ELASTICSEARCH_INTEGRATION_ERROR`
  - [ ] non-empty `message`

## 12. Not-Yet-In-Scope Checks

### Not Implemented Yet

- [ ] Workspace management beyond the current create/list/read surface and default-workspace bootstrap
- [ ] Hybrid or vector-assisted ranking
- [ ] Search snippets, highlights, or richer retrieval UX

### Placeholder Checks For Later

- [ ] When hybrid retrieval exists, verify lexical-only fallback behavior remains understandable.
- [ ] Keep verifying that Repo B does not depend on FastAPI `/videos/search`.
