# Phase 1 Closure Summary

Historical note: this records the Phase 1 closure decision at that time. Later Phase 2 work has since added ownership/auth, transcript snapshot persistence, workspace lifecycle expansion, search refinement, and release-readiness/runbook improvements. Use the current API/runbook docs for present-day behavior.

## Objective of Phase 1

Phase 1 aimed to prove a narrow search-first MVP for AI Knowledge Workspace with Spring Boot as the product-facing boundary. The goal was not a production-ready app or chatbot/RAG system. The goal was a coherent demo path for workspace-scoped upload, processing follow-up, transcript access, explicit indexing, search, and search-hit context.

## Achieved Outcomes

- Spring Boot now owns the client-facing product flow and API surface.
- Repo B persists the minimal product core needed for the slice: `Workspace`, `Asset`, and `ProcessingJob`.
- The implemented backend flow covers:
  - workspace create/list/read
  - workspace-aware asset listing
  - asset upload
  - status polling
  - transcript retrieval
  - transcript context retrieval
  - explicit indexing
  - Spring-owned search
  - title update and asset deletion
- Elasticsearch indexing is explicit, rerun-safe, and refreshed before success is returned.
- Lightweight tests, smoke verification, and local-dev tooling are in place for the demo path.
- The frontend repo is aligned to the same narrow Spring-owned MVP flow.

## Intentionally Deferred

- auth, ownership enforcement, and collaboration
- transcript persistence
- chatbot/RAG behavior
- background retries, orchestration, schedulers, or Temporal-style workflow management
- advanced search tuning and richer asset inventory features
- production-grade UI polish, media-player UX, and broader frontend surface

These items remain deferred by design. They are not Phase 1 defects that must be closed before transition.

## Closure Decision

Phase 1 is considered practically closed.

The implemented slice is sufficient for the intended search-first MVP and demo path. Remaining items are mostly deliberate scope deferrals or future product-direction questions, not unfinished Phase 1 obligations.

## Transition Note

Phase 2 should begin from planning and decision-making, not from immediate coding. The next step is to choose a small number of Phase 2 tracks deliberately, rather than reopening Phase 1 for broad cleanup.
